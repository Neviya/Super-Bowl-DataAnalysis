# Super-Bowl-DataAnalysis
Load, clean, and explore Super Bowl data in the age of soaring ad costs and halftime shows
In this project, we will find out how some of the elements of the Super Bowl shows interact with each other. We try to answer questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
